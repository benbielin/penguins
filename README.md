# Penguins

The goal of this project is to learn R programming. I decided to use this penguins dataset because, well, penguins! (Penguins are cool.) The first goal was to learn `dplyr` and `tidyverse`. The second goal was to learn machine learning in R. I already had experience with `pandas` and `scikit-learn` in Python, so I wanted to work on something similar in R and see what the similiarities and differences were.
